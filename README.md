This is a practice problem to help me learn the basics of Reinforcement Learning. Here, i teach a Taxi to pick up and drop off passengers at the right locations with Reinforcement Learning.

## About The Practice Problem: 
The Smartcab's job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop them off in another. Here are a few things that we'd love our Smartcab to take care of:

Drop off the passenger to the right location.
Save passenger's time by taking minimum time possible to drop off
Take care of passenger's safety and traffic rules

## Approach
We use Q-Learning to teach a Taxi to pick up and drop off passengers at the right locations.
